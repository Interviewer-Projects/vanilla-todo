# Vanilla Todo
This is a simple todo project that my interviewer ask me to build!

## Task:
Develop a simple To-Do application using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Requirements:
### Core Functionality:
- Users should be able to add items to a to-do list, each with a title and description.
- Items can be removed from the list.
- Each item can be marked as done or rolled back to undone.
- Each item has a creation date and last update date. We have to save the timestamp in our code, but the user will see it with the
following format: 17:30 - 23. Aug 2023

### Technologies:
- The application must be written using pure TypeScript and CSS, without relying on any external libraries.
- The design should be simple but functional, with no need for an elaborate aesthetic.

### Data Persistence:
- Data doesn't need to be saved permanently on any server; it will only persist as long as the browser session is active.
- Closing the browser will cause all data to be lost.

### Documentation:
- Comprehensive documentation must be provided for each function, class, variable, and property.
- All TypeScript types must be clearly defined.

### Instructions:
- Utilize best practices for software development.
- Use Object-Oriented Programming.
- Focus on code readability and maintainability.
- Avoid adding any side effects in your code.
